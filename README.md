## ❓ FAQ

### 📂 Where will the files be stored after running the script?

The servers are stored in subdirectories of the folder where you run the script.  
For example, if you run the script in: `C:\Games\PrivateServers`  
A **Zenless Zone Zero** server might be stored in: `C:\Games\PrivateServers\zzz\trigger-rs`  
Each server will have its own subdirectory within the main folder.

### 🔄 Will the script redownload existing files?

No. If you execute the script in the same directory again, it will detect existing files and update them if possible, rather than redownloading everything.
